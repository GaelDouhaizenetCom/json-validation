It also has three onboard computers.\nBut the robots won\u2019t be able to chase you down anytime soon. The routine took months of development, the company said, and it is far from perfect.\nAtlas gets the vault right about half the time and can lose its balance and fall backwards on some of the runs, the company said.\n\u201cThere are a lot of pretty exciting behaviours here, and some of them are not totally reliable yet,\u201d said Ben Stephens, the Atlas controls lead.\n\u201cEvery behaviour here has a small chance of failure. It\u2019s almost 90 seconds of continuous jumping, jogging, turning, vaulting, and flipping, so those probabilities add up\u201d.\nAtlas is currently a research model, unlike its model Spot, that aims to push the limits of robotics. The company says the parkour practise will be useful for future helper robots in developing the same range of movement and flexibility as humans.\n\"I find it hard to imagine a world 20 years from now where there aren\u2019t capable mobile robots that move with grace, reliability, and work alongside humans to enrich our lives,\u201d said Atlas team leader Scott Kuindersma.\n\u201cBut we\u2019re still in the early days of creating that future. I hope that demonstrations like this provide a small glimpse of what\u2019s possible\u201d.", "tags": ["technology", "new technologies", "robot", "robotic", "united states", "athletics"], "authors": ["Pascale Davies"], "links": ["https://www.euronews.com/next/2021/07/05/this-french-robotics-start-up-may-have-the-solution-for-the-ageing-population-crisis", "https://www.euronews.com/next/2021/07/03/amazon-will-develop-autonomous-delivery-robot-tech-in-finland", "https://www.euronews.com/2018/02/13/a-boston-dynamics-robot-can-now-open-doors"]}
